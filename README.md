This is a diff/merge app for C# model classes to SQL Server. You can also merge from database to database. Here's my main [product page](https://aosoftware.net/modelsync/).

The app has a 30-day fully functional free trial. After that, a perpetual license is $50 USD.

You're welcome to clone and examine this repo of course. If you use Model Sync for real, I do ask you to please buy a license.

## About the Repo
- The WinForms UI is the [App](https://github.com/adamfoneil/ModelSync.WinForms/tree/master/ModelSync.App) project, this repo.
- You will also need to clone the [ModelSync library](https://github.com/adamfoneil/ModelSync) project because the App references the `ModelSync` library as a project within the solution. This allowed me to get the best debug experience.
